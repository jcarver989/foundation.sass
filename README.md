Foundation.sass
======================

Foundation.sass is a set of useful css mixins for sass (http://sass-lang.com/) 
that makes life on the front-end much easer. Inspired in part by Mark Otto's Bootstrap.less (http://www.markdotto.com/bootstrap/). See examples/examples.html
for more information.
